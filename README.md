# Dataset and Code for my Thesis
- This repositoriy contains the datasets and source code used to train models in kaggle.
## Dataset
- My dataset has approximately 2038 images of Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) buses and Thai Smile Bus (TSB) electric buses.
- You can view and download the dataset directly from the Roboflow website here : [Bangkok-Bus-Dataset-YOLOV8](https://universe.roboflow.com/saint70239/bangkok-bus-dataset)
## Code
- My code is in the form of the ipynb file extension, which runs on the Kaggle website, where I have chosen to use the accelerator as an Nvidia Tesla P100 graphics card.
